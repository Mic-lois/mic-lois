### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Let me go ahead and introduce myself! I'm a digital designer who words in the Graphic Design and Front-End Development Spaces. I'm five years into being a Graphic Designer and a year into being a Front-End Developer.

- ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on a personal project that doesn't exactly have a name yet.
- ğŸŒ± I'm currently learning C.
- ğŸ’¬ I'm a horror genre lover.
- ğŸ˜„ And, when I'm not at my computer I'm cycling or sutyding languages.  

That about wraps up introduction. Ask me about anything you like, I'm around!
